# Types of Functions Project: Create and Mint Token

This project is an ERC-20 token implementation that allows the owner to mint new tokens, and any user to transfer and burn tokens.

## Description

This is a custom ERC-20 token built using the OpenZeppelin library. This smart contract includes functionalities for minting, transferring, and burning tokens. Only the contract owner has the privilege to mint new tokens, ensuring control over the total supply. Any user can transfer and burn their tokens. This contract serves as a basic example for creating and managing a custom ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Features

- Minting Tokens: Only the contract owner can mint new tokens.
- Transferring Tokens: Any user can transfer tokens to another address.
- Burning Tokens: Any user can burn their own tokens, reducing the total supply.
- Ownership Control: The owner can renounce ownership to make the contract fully decentralized.
